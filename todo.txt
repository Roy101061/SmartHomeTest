#7/4
infrared remote (if the guess is right)
return data to IOT
check if the sensor is the right one or not
consider the pins place
vcc is only for power or let it be a output
bread board?
convert into one single code?
esp8266 installation?
is include DHT.h available?
water_level file needs to be confirmed (was that a full water_level or only one layer)
bring the full set of Arduino.

#7/5
garbage confirmed (too close bug fix by if the distance >1000, take it as close.)
temp_hum_index need to be confirmed bc not sure if the data is right.

#7/6
found infrared sender and receiver, started to code (using library "IRremote")

#7/7
infrared_send type2 error (it stuck, type is sony.)
infrared_send cant detect by infrared_get (not sure if its the sender or the code is wrong.)

#7/18
infrared need to change to arduino to check if the light is broke, and if the IrRemote doesn't support node_esp32s ( ESP32 (ESP32 C3 since board package 2.0.2 from Espressif), ESP8266 This fork supports an impressive set of protocols and a lot of air conditioners )
the infrared_sender need to check the pins next time bc just broke one (S=data, -=gnd, mid=5V)

#7/19 
infrared change to uno, but seems not working, maybe the light broke, node32s support or not need to check.
the water_level sensor not accurate, need to check the problem
